ARbDrone
========

Ruby Library for the Parrot AR.Drone
------------------------------------

ARbDrone is a native Ruby implementation of the protocols necessary to control
the [http://ardrone.parrot.com/](Parrot AR.Drone).

This library is brand new and will take some time to mature.  Current work
is focused around the flight control commands and navdata.  Video support
is not likely to appear for some time.
